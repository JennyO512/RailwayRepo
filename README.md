# Cover Letter and Resume Creator

This code uses the Flask web framework to create a simple web application. When the user navigates to the home page, they can enter the position they applied for and submit the form to generate a cover letter. The position is passed to the OpenAI API to generate the cover letter, and the response is then saved to a word document named "cover_letter.docx" in the root of your project.
